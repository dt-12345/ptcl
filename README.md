A simple tool for changing colors in PTCL files, features are very limited but hopefully it suffices for certain applications

### EXAMPLE USAGE

```sh
# Extract color info from a file
python3 main.py AncientBall.Nin_NX_NVN.esetb.byml # replace paths with your path

# Apply edits to a file
python3 main.py AncientBall.Nin_NX_NVN.esetb.byml AncientBall.Nin_NX_NVN.esetb.byml.json # replace paths with your path
```
